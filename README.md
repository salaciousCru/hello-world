### Geo

I live in Binningen in canton Baselland in Switzerland

### Reading

Three of my favourite books are:

- **Narrenturm** by Andrzej Sapkowski
- **The Witcher Saga** also by Andrzej Sapkowski
- **Master and Margareth** by Michail Bulhakov

### Food

I'm trying my best to eat healthy and not to get bored with it. Almost vegetarian because I love animals and nature. It makes me feel more in tune. 
Cooking is one of many food passions, amongst baking, gardening and experimenting. 
I'll eat it as long as it did not move XD

### Contact

Best way to get in touch with me is to knock on my door.
